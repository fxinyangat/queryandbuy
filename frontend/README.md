*E-commerce Search Engine, Like Google but for Retail.*

## *Executive Summary*

ShopQnB is an AI-powered search engine for e-commerce, designed to redefine how users discover and purchase products online. Unlike traditional marketplaces, where users must manually search, filter, and compare products, ShopQnB leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to interpret user queries in plain language and return top-quality product recommendations, ranked based on relevance, price, reliability, and user reviews.

By integrating real-time data from multiple e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, Jumia, Takealot, eBay, etc.), ShopQnB enables users to make smarter purchasing decisions instantly, without switching between multiple sites.

## *ShopQnB Value Proposition*
	‚Ä¢	AI-Driven Search Engine for E-Commerce ‚Äì Uses NLP to understand user intent, rather than relying on keyword-based search.
	‚Ä¢	Dynamic Product Ranking ‚Äì AI ranks results based on price, availability, seller reputation, verified reviews, and delivery speed.
	‚Ä¢	Seamless Checkout Across Platforms ‚Äì Users can buy from multiple stores via a single interface, with AI auto-filling checkout details.
	‚Ä¢	Fraud Prevention & Trust

 ## *How It Works*
	‚Ä¢	Uses advanced NLP models (spaCy, OpenAI GPT, BERT) to extract intent and product attributes from user queries.
	‚Ä¢	Semantic search algorithms match user intent with real-time product data from integrated APIs.
 	‚Ä¢	Search algorithm retrieves the results and re-ranks them based on user specs, seller repuation, price and other factors.
  ‚Ä¢	Filtered results are returned back to the user via a seamless easy to use interface, so the user can make the purchase decision.

## *Technical Learning Outcomes*

From building ShopQnB, I developed technical expertise in:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) ‚Äì Using BERT, GPT, and spaCy for search intent analysis.
- API Integration & Data Aggregation ‚Äì Connecting multiple third-party APIs (Amazon, Shopify, Walmart).
- E-Commerce Search Ranking ‚Äì Implementing AI-powered product ranking algorithms.
- Python & Flask Backend Development ‚Äì Creating scalable, API-driven architectures.
- Frontend Development with React.js ‚Äì Building a minimalist, conversational UI.
- Cloud Deployment & DevOps ‚Äì Deploying scalable services on AWS/GCP.

## **Why ShopQnB Matters for Underserved Markets**
Many emerging markets (especially in Africa & Asia) face challenges in e-commerce:
	1.	Limited access to reliable product pricing & availability.
	2.	Lack of transparency in reviews & product quality.
	3.	Inconsistent payment & delivery options.
 While in the US, consumers always hussle with different platforms offering similar products at varying prices, different terms.
 Our goal is to search the different options and information about products and give power to the user to make the best choice.
